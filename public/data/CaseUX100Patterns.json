If it is easy to find examples, we consider the product relevant and make an intuitive purchase decision. Availability heuristic is an illusory correlation between ease of finding an example and frequency of need. Factors influencing cognitive ease include repeated experience, clear representation, priming, good mood, and subjective effort in searching for examples. What we easily remember appears more probable or relevant. This explains the fear of flying due to media coverage of plane crashes. In e-commerce, familiar product names, text formatting, repetition of key messages, and linking products to media events can influence availability. The availability heuristic can also be used to influence satisfaction surveys by making it easy for customers to identify areas for improvement.",
