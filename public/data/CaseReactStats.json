One to get metrics about the project, one to prepare a folder for assets and one to manage those assets automatically."

The script uses obviosly the os library to do traverse it and some regex to filter out react hooks. It is useful to get a quick insight how many lines you have written or where you components might be too large. The Other 2 commands [make-assets] and [auto-assets] are used to create an asset folder and automatically clean new files."
